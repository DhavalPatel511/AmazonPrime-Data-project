#  Amazon Prime Video Content Analysis (ETL + SQL Analytics)

This repository showcases a complete data analytics pipeline built on the **Medallion Architecture (Bronze → Silver → Gold)** to analyze Amazon Prime Video content using SQL Server.

The project involves structured data engineering, cleaning, modeling, and insight generation through SQL queries, designed for both BI reporting and ad-hoc analysis.

## 🏗️ ETL Pipeline

The project follows a layered approach:

| Layer       | Description |
|-------------|-------------|
| **Bronze**  | Raw CSV data ingested into SQL Server (`amazonprime_raw`) via Python |
| **Silver**  | Cleaned and normalized data (e.g., duration buckets, ratings, director/cast/genre split tables) |
| **Gold**    | Business-ready views (`vw_amazonprime_summary`, `vw_amazonprime_full`) for reporting |

## 🧠 Analytical Questions Covered

A total of **12 insights** are answered using SQL queries, such as:

1. Which director has directed the most movies and TV shows?
2. What is the genre-wise duration distribution?
3. Who are the most common director–actor collaborators?
4. What percentage of movies fall into each duration bucket?
5. Genre and rating breakdowns over time

See [`queries.sql`](scripts/queries.sql) for full details.
